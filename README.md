# Craft Digital Ltd. contract

This is the standard contract to which I—acting as Craft Digital Ltd.—operate.
This contract can be amended and updated to be tailored to individual clients
and projects, this is merely a boilerplate.

This is a fork of Harry Roberts' (CSSWizardry) [Contract Boilerplate](https://github.com/csswizardry/Contract) - amended for my personal needs.

## Changes to original

Aside from personalising it to incorporate my details, I have made two significant changes to Harry's original:
+ Removed mention of conference presentations / talks (incl. ref. to copyright of such material)
+ Changed payment detail structure 

## Thank you

Massive thanks to [Harry Roberts](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) for this contract.
